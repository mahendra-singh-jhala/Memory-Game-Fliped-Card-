# 🃏 Memory Card Game

A simple and engaging memory card game where users must match pairs of cards. The game presents face-down cards, and when a user clicks on a card, it flips to reveal its value. If two flipped cards match, they remain visible. If not, the cards flip back over. The game continues until all pairs are matched.

## 🎮 Features

- Flip-to-reveal card mechanism
- Match logic with visual feedback
- Automatic hiding of unmatched cards
- Game ends when all pairs are matched
- Simple and intuitive interface

## 🚀 How to Play

1. Click any card to flip it.
2. Click a second card to find its match.
3. If the cards match, they stay face-up.
4. If they don't match, they flip back after a short delay.
5. Repeat until all cards are matched.
